# WP-CLI Remote Command

Manage your WordPress sites using WP Remote and WP-CLI.

**Note:** This is an alpha, prototype, very prone to breakage experiment. Use at your own risk.

If you would like to play with this before WP-CLI incorporates a package installer, you'll want to:

1. Make sure you're using WP-CLI `dev-master`.
1. Create a `wp-cli.yml` file in your project root.
1. Require the base command file from your `.yml`.
